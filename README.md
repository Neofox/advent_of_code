## Solutions

You can find the solutions for each day in the corresponding folders. The solutions are implemented in Javascript (Node.js), and each folder contains the source code along with any necessary input files.

Feel free to explore the solutions and adapt them to your needs. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a simple folder structure:

- `day_01`, `day_02`, etc.: Folders for each day's challenge.
- `index.js`: Source code for the solution.
- `input.txt`: Input file for the respective day's challenge.
- `test.txt`: Test file (reduce example input file) for the respective day's challenge.

## Usage

To run a specific day's solution, you can use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the corresponding day's folder.
2. Run the solution script (e.g., `node index.js`).

Make sure you have node installed on your machine.
